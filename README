KDTree in C++11

1. 	To build, run the make command in the directory of kdtree. This will build
	two applications build_kdtree, query_kdtree

2. 	Run as ./build_kdree. It will ask for a file name that contains sample data.
	Enter the name and press enter. Then it will ask the name of file to dump
	the tree. Enter the name and press enter.

3. Run as ./query_kdtree. It will ask the name of file to read the tree from. Enter the
	the name of file which you created using build_tree binary.
	Then it will ask you the file that contains query points. Enter the name of the file
	Then it will ask the name of file that to enter the answers to each query entry.
	The nearest point index for each query and the Euclidean distance between them would
	be present in this answer file.

Note: 	sample data files and query point files are comma separated.
		Code builds with C++11 flag on g++ compiler.

		Use make clean to delete the binary files.

		To change the precision from double to float, change the value of
		#define PRECISION in the cpp files respectively.
